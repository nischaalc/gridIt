Grid It!
========

Grid It! is a command line game I created as part of an assignment. 

The objective is to clear the on screen grid of as many X's as possible. This is done through moving X's in the grid. 
X's are only able to move if there is an O in between the starting point and the destination and you can enter these points
as coordinates.
